\lettersection{Introduction}
I am very interested in your Data Engineer position. I am a data engineer with more than two years of experience in data analysis and processing. I am currently working at Axenix on a banking project, where I develop and optimize ETL processes using Airflow, Kafka, Hadoop, Greenplum and other technologies for the DWH core. Previously I worked at Spacecode and ASC "DirectService", where I was engaged in building analytical DWH and developing services with ML model support. My key skills include working with big data, ETL/ELT, SQL, Python and DevOps practices.

\lettersection{Why your company?}
I am attracted by your company's international status. I really liked the job description, the familiar technology stack and some aspects that I would like to dive deeper into. I hope that I will be able to implement this in your project. In particular, a deeper dive into Python and, perhaps, industrial experience with NoSQL databases.

\lettersection{Why me?}
Based on the job description, my experience with ETL/ELT processes on Airflow, dbt, building DWH on PostgreSQL and Greenplum, query optimization and DBMS operations is a perfect fit for you. Throughout my studies and work, I constantly delve into architectural details, trying to understand and use the advantages of different programming languages and tools. I know the basics of Go and C++ and their advantages, but I mainly program in Python. I have experience with setting up CI/CD, configuring servers via Ansible and setting up clusters for Docker Swarm / Hadoop. In addition, I have experience in data science, participating in ML hackathons and winning an all-Russian hackathon in development using ML.
